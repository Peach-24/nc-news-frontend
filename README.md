# A news website made using React

<br>

This repo contains the source code for a frontend [website](https://nc-news-peach-24.netlify.app/) I've built for a fictional news website called Northcoders News.

The frontend interacts with a backend API I've built which you can find [here](https://github.com/Peach-24/nc-news-backend).

As a viewer of the the site, you:

- begin on the landing page where you will see a number of selected articles for each topic
- Can login for additional features (HINT: login using a username you can find on the site)
- are able to upvote or downvote on articles and comments (only once per session)
- can navigate to stories sorted by date posted (Latest) and most commented (Popular)
- can click on 'Random' to view a random article on the site.

As a logged-in user on the site, you can:

- Post comments on articles
- Delete your own comments

### Further planned developments:

- The ability for logged in users to post articles
- Dynamic date on the home page
- Rotating top stories displayed on the home page
